Charlie Kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular but this canadian gem makes it hilarious Like most weird films the less said about plot the better but lets set the scene two friends Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood they cant cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to But that is where even more problems begin I loved this film it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of nothing out there Dont miss this

I love this episode of Columbo Maybe its because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell an American version of Dame Agatha Christie She is delicious to watch as the perky lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident She blames her nieces husband the nephew She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her I would have loved somebody else than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica I never really like Hartley in anything personally And of course with Columbo there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica at a belly dancing class Ruths Abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk

Picture the scene a mountainous alien landscape Twin moons illuminate the blood red sky The Tardis lands and out steps the Doctor a middle aged man in a Victorian frock coat and Rose his companion from Earth A flicker of recognition crosses his face Well I never Its the planet Saurious Where I fought the warlike Kraggartians They tried to use giant Skinkons to take over the planet The girl sniffs the air Cant we go Doctor I dont like the look of this place I keep thinking were being watched The Doctor wags a disapproving finger Dont be silly girl I wonder if the King and Queen of Cordaraby City remember me from my last visit Come along Rose come along He strides off the girl struggles to keep up High on a hill sinister red eyes regard them with hatred That was not how Rose began back in and thank heavens for that say I Unfairly derided at the time of its original U K broadcast Rose can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode putting Dr Who back where it belonged as one of the B B C s flagship programmes The mistakes made by the McGann T V movie were well learnt Instead of trying to shoehorn the new Who into existing chronology it represented a fresh start for the series beginning with shop girl Rose Tyler Billie Piper going about her daily routine One day she goes to the basement to find a man named Wilson and then the trouble begins Mannequins come to life and attack her It is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger Christopher Eccleston that she is saved The story slight though it may be is more than adequate as a starting point for the series The Autons are of course an old villain this was their first appearance since but no references are made to their past appearances another wise move The finale effectively recreated the famous scene in Spearhead From Space when shop window dummies sprang to life As the Doctor Christopher Eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors preferring a modern leather jacket to the Doctors traditional period clothes but this made him more accessible to the shows hoped for new audience Billie Piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as Rose Also good was Noel Clarke as her boyfriend Mickey Yes there was an added emphasis on special effects but then there needed to be the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on st century television What is more important is how good a script this is Ten million people tuned in to see the new Doctor Dr Who was back and back with a bang

David Beckham is a British soccer star and the husband of Victoria Beckham Posh Spice of the Spice Girls His trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net The soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball Bend it like Beckham means making that type of spectacular shot Apart from that and a little shrine to him in the main characters bedroom and a faux cameo at the very end the movie has nothing to do with him The movie is full of little soccer in jokes such as the present that one of the characters parents give her of a jersey with the number on it property of the great Mia Hamm to those in the know references to Posh n Becks the video homage to the WUSA one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend They have that lesbian gags sports bra gags and so on The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a soccer star She has a real gift but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional womens league in the UK hence their fascination with our WUSA and her parents who are Indian immigrants set in very old fashioned ways that do not allow daughters among other things to engage in contact sports The girls family are portrayed as figures of ironic fun but with great affection think My Big Fat Greek Wedding The girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to conceal her growing soccer stardom from them

On paper this movie would sound incredibly boring The idea of a year old man traveling the country side on a riding mower certainly doesnt have much appeal to it but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than The Straight Story The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl Shes pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out Alvin tells her a story about his own kids long ago He had them each take a stick and break it which they could easily do Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them That bundle he said is family So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger The Straight Story realizes that were smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions Alvins journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un Hollywood character interactions Each interaction is full of warmth and humor and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we cant help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother Lyle who has suffered a stroke And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey Its a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets to their benefit and ours Its a slow simple relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that weve lost with the urbanization of America The Straight Story is the rare live action G rated movie that truly should not be missed Grade A

This is a great film Classic from the s and well produced There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield Al Schmid Force of Evil and Dane Clark Lee Diamond Last Rites fighting the Japs during WWII being completely surrounded and with only one machine gun When Al Schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend Dane Clark gave an outstanding supporting role as Lee Diamond who did everything to help his buddy Al get his life together again There is never a complete victory to War and lets not forget all the Brave Wounded Military personnel in Veterans Hospitals from All the Wars and our present Iraq Vets

Footlight Parade is fascinating on so many levels There is no way the supposedly staged theater prologues could have been produced in any theater on earth of course Think of the huge pools and three story tall fountains for By A Waterfall for instance Berkeley directed John Garfield in They Made Me a Criminal six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing By a Waterfall as they took their showers Shanghai Lil is the best production number in the picture Its a catalog of s Warner Bros sensibilities Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of Roosevelts image Theres also the NRA eagle the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that hed pull the nation out of the Depression Youd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM of course Warner Bros wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F D R administration Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker Lil She hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws The Pre Code stuff is fun The By a Waterfall number is wonderful in that regard The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on The spread eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for years In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures

I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out As a result I dont remember anything about the movie But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilleys and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lees hit song Lookin for Love which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it However a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is I was blown away Few movies have hit me harder This movie is as raw and real as you can get From Uncle Bobs ranch house the chemical plant in Texas City Gilleys dance hall and Bud and Sissy And maybe for that reason it doesnt have a wider appeal But no matter how you feel about country music I for one cant stand it despite my Houston roots Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie For that reason I love it

If only Eddie Murphy were born years later Then wed all remember it But even I was only when it came out If you havent seen it yet rent Dr Dolittle Showtime I spy Pluto Nash and all Eddies family comedy movies then watch this Hands down youll laugh of the time The other youll be wiping the tears from your eyes It really needs to be watched more then once to understand all the jokes From crude humor to a joke for kids if youve seen it youll laugh here youll love his stuff If you can or are a big fan try to download clips from Eddies acts Allot of the shows are different as youd imagine and he has even more funny jokes But this is like the best of Eddie Murphy X rated if you will And all I can say is please dont watch Delirious if you dont like comedy dont have a sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with You will only put down this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly make someone miss out on it If you wanna know how Eddie got Beverly Hills Cop and got famous from it Delirious is it

I liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the Amazon a part of the world that always has intrigued me I believe a condensed form of the book was published in Readers Digest soon after the actual event occurred Because I am a baby boomer the character and the actress are my contemporaries and for this reason I related to the film I also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the characters following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help as well as other survival techniques Most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude In conclusion I hope viewers learn something from it in addition seeing it for entertainment I do wish the movie would be released in VHS and DVD soon as I should like to add it to my video collection It also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels

I got to see this just this last Friday at the Los Angeles film festival at Laemlees on Beverly This movie got the most applause of all the films that evening Considering that two music videos opened first I didnt know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing I wasnt sure I was ready for a short immediately But to my surprise I really enjoyed this I thought the main actor demon guy was really good I was so impressed with his performance that I checked out his name I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade guy Hes gotten really good especially since then Either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short The girl did an okay job I guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young The dad did well also There was a lot of really nice cg work for a short both for this and the short playing next Mexican Hat which was also nice but I enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and I actually cared about the characters The other was a very simple story The story was quite illustrative and dark It dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep ADD people like me interested We wont even talk about the last film in the block which I left My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started which is why I gave it a out of I also thought the end credits went a little slowly Otherwise it was beautifully told directed and edited The timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast MTV editing done on everything nowadays There will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor I now will think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor not the Witchblade guy

This was a wonderful film How these women tried to save their husbands I thought that the performances of the actors were great I had to think about the film for a very long time I think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war relationships friendship and love I liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be I wish I could be so strong as a woman I really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what I like to see in a movie I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang The pianist If you put these three films together you have a great sight of what happened during the war We should remember something like the war forever

spoilers I was blown away by this movie Ive been renting on movielink for a bit and decided to check this movie out Alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood In this movie it shows it at the amature level Though I do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades The movie points out the problems some families face with gender I was a bit concerned with the ending But the ending wasnt a disappointment either I think it was pretty clear by the title that shed win What was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end Loved the score for some of the scenes Highly recommended Quality Entertainment Replayable

If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it then Tigerland is the film for you I love this movie from top to bottom This movies picture perfect scenes look so real its almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama Boy I tell you REAL drama they actually real fought in one of the scenes get the DVD listen to the commentary its not obvious I see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill fated destiny after watching Saving Private Ryan I have an a appreciation of what an ill fated destiny is and know exactly how the men in the film feel I see this movie as a crossbreed between Stand By Me and Saving Private Ryan What do men do when they are with a situation thats hard pressed in real life Some men go crazy some men cry some men through fists others do drugs some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life some try drink the pain away some jump off buildings or bridges some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse physically This movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball But dont get me wrong its not depressing movie its realistic its a very very humorous movie the cocky and funny Bozz Collins Character lights it all up and on top of that there are about female actresses in the movie Ill let you figure out what their in there for With dialogue war action sequences picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music this movie has it all like I said from top to bottom I dont why Tigerland is heavily under credited The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing The best film of the year and it absolutely falls nothing short of that Keep the rare gems coming Hollywood

Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film There isnt a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad Mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited

Why didnt this pick up a bag full of Oscars It is an amazing interpretaion of an oft filmed performed piece The visuals are breathtaking especially in wide screen the pan scan really kills this films wonderful cinematography and sets Every frame is a painting Astounding The play is almost completely intact and Branaghs passion for it is clear from the opening titles on No Zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlets murderous Uncle he doesnt play him as a mustache curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only Hamlet suspects foul play Branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between Hamlets fake real madness and the burning revenge inside him And the many cameos come off quite well everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into Branaghs vision the way I was A mesmerizing piece

The Straight Story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he cant drive and he wants to make the rip by himself The film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role At first I felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but I soon discovered that Lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie I would recommend to anyone

Maybe it wasnt that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one I say was so memorable I still remember it today I became a fan of Dick Francis I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries The cockney slang of the sidekick Chico Barnes is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing Londons Bow Bells but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting Sid Halley was one of Francis more interesting characters and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand Interestingly electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after World War II

The US State Dept would not like us to see this movie because they have a beef with the Iranian govt However it shows us just how civilized Iran really is despite the content of the film which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium which is strictly limited to male audiences alone The film is hilariously funny and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran I enjoyed this movie intensely Five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between Iran and Bahrain The ensuing comedy is too funny to describe from the bus trip to the stadium to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls to the resulting end Dont miss this classic film Its a MUST see One of the best foreign films Ive seen in years

I think Lion King is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three Lion King movies In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as Timon having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats Timon and Pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also Simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping Simba face his evil Uncle Scar and proclaim his right as the Lion King of Pride Rock Filled with wonderful new characters like Timons Ma Julie Kavner and Uncle Max Jerry Stiller I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian Jerry Stiller the father of Ben Stiller Disney was smart to cast Stiller in that role Filled with wonderful characters animation and story and music Lion King is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than Simbas Pride even though I will admit I really did like that one too Lion King is a great Disney sequel the whole family can enjoy Its got a good story and is very funney out of

A comedy gem Lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly laughing uncontrollably The characters are recognisable and the dialogue well observed I know people like this The humour is surprisingly gentle and the film this may sound strange puts me in mind of an Ealing Comedy Its a quirky little film with lots of detail It certainly takes a number of viewings Ive watched it a few times Ive been showing all my friends and notice something new each time a bit of dialogue something visual that I hadnt picked up on before I could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but Im not going to because overall this is a great fun feel good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy It is a film which will find its friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there Oh and It has a great soundtrack

Ive been trying to find out about this series for ages Thank you IMDb I saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind As a year old of course I was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine which I still have What I also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious austere and extremely authentic When I read the original many years later I experienced that same sensation Its a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in Hollywood Every Odyssey Ive seen since has been an enormous let down The characters in this series seemed genuine real people ancient Greek people and not some Hollywood stars in costumes This is a real masterpiece But Why is it not better known And why isnt it available on VHS or DVD I would just love to have the chance to see this again

Well What can I say other than these people are Super in every way I quite like Sharon Mcreedy I enjoy this pure Nostalgic Series And I have the boxed set of discs episodes I did not realise that they had made so many I also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more I wish that I got given these powers Imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital Later on I discover that my body has been enhanced Just like Richard Barrat These stories are Minutes of pure action and suspense all the way You cannot fight these people as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry The music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of super beings in my mind The sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats Improved sight Improved hearing and touch and the strength of men for Richard and Craig and the strength of women for Sharon Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent When I was a boy I had a huge crush on her Now I can see why on my DVD set The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series I also thought that Trymane was a good boss firm but he got things done

On one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again On a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land I thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when Im not out here alone for any length of time I feel unrooted I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists Im familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery installations But to see his work in motion captured perfectly through Riedelsheimers lens was a revelation Unfrozen in time Goldsworthys creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashing And thats precisely what hes all about Time The process of creation and destruction Of emergence and disappearing Of coming out of the Void and becoming the Universe and back again Theres a shamanic quality about him verging on madness You get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didnt do it he would whither and perish Luckily for us Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography Otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person

When I was chairman of our colleges coffeehouse one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities One of the best things to come along in was Groove Tube The original premise was that it was being shown off off Broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience so everyone had a great seat The premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis ala Saturday Night Live keeping the thing fresh They decided on making it into a film for general distribution I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film Watching him run naked though the woods was a howl Like many of the reviews before mine it WAS Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed I highly recommend this vid Ive told my year old son about Koko the clown He cant wait to get a copy

Im disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film Jordi Mollà probably best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demmes Blow Writes directs and stars I wont give away any plot points as the movie at least for me was very exciting having not known anything about it If you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would carry it I highly recommend it Its a crazy fun and sometimes very thought provoking creation Mollàs direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promise Unpredictable with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful Spanish No somos nadie God is on Air is an amazing film you can show off to your friends SEE IT

Jiøí Trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism which caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia The elements are few the symbolisms simple and his trademark ornaments almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable A man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself The man refuses and hes persecuted by the ominous gloved hand In these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment

Get ready for it This is one of my favourite films of all time I am relatively unaware of David Mamets writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times its always a joy to watch I can say without hesitation that he is a genius This film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit con artistry and back room hustles The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting and it also pays homage to film noir Its quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters It is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch Generally the acting is superb especially Joe Mantegna but someone who I watched the film with remarked to me that its not a good idea to have a heroine Lindsay Crouse who is not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad s hairdo I agree but I think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role The less you know about the plot of this film the better just like Mamets most recent film The Spanish Prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance

Contrary to what those who hate Christianity the Club provides real answers as well as inspiration It also provides reliable news logical commentary and a different view than what ABC CBS NBC and PBS thinks is best Unlike other programs which provide social and faith related commentary those who are behind the Club provide help for those in need such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing providing medical help to those living in poverty stricken communities and giving hope to those who need hope Its not at all hateful If the Club offends you I suggest reaching for the remote control and turning the channel on your TV set I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or for that matter programs which I find biased or offensive What I find offensive is the way that the ABC Family inserts the disclaimer that the views of the Club do not reflect those of ABC Family

Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family Before the real story of the movie starts we get a performance of the Bad Tour Man In The Mirror and it kicks off a great movie After that we get a kind of a collage of Michael carrier as it was until Moonwalker came out in After a few Music Videos also Speed Demon Leave Me Alone etc the story starts The plot is basically that Michael and his friends who are kids are being chased by the bad guy of the story Mr Big because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs During the chase we see fantastic segments fx Michaels video for Smooth Criminal which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences etc But then one of the kids get kidnapped by Mr Big and Michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict During the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards but also impressive today For instance see Michael turning in to a robot spaceship in order to protect his friends Its so cool The movie ends with a performance of Come Together later published in Michaels double album of HIStory and you leave the movie with a magic feeling Amazing I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV And now some parents might stand up and say But Michael Jackson is an alleged child abuser Yeah he is indeed but come on we all know it isnt true Wait and see

I must admit that at the beginning I was sort of reticent about watching this movie I thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie Still I watched it And I was amazed Before Sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy tales The ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six oclock in Viennas station in our optimism we sincerely hope so The actors acted in a very good manner so that I began to believe that I myself could live a love story just like this

Though I saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me Stephen Reas depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers

Ive read most of the comments on this movie I have seen this movie and the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts The movie is just based on biblical facts I have seen a lot of end time movies Tribulation Armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths It may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but I believe it is a good witnessing tool This movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise com and judge for yourself Blessings to all

With the release of Peter Jacksons famed Lord of the Rings trilogy it is even easier to dismiss Ralph Bakshis animated Lord of the Rings film as inferior I agree with the majority that Jacksons trilogy is the essential film adaptation of Tolkiens work but that does not prevent me from enjoying Bakshis ambitious pioneering effort Jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing Bakshis film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations The films colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable I was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters The pairs of Pippin and Merry and Eowyn and Galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually the Balrog and Treebeard were unimpressive but these points didnt bother me very much However the Nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie The only character representation I was bothered by was Sams he was made to look unbecomingly silly This film is novel for its animation techniques In addition to hand drawn characters live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping It is quite apparent which characters are hand drawn and which are rotoscoped but none the less I found that the films style was a novelty The use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well The voice acting was generally of high quality Particularly good was John Hurt who provided an authoritative voice for Aragorn Aragorn isnt a favorite character of mine from the stories but backed by John Hurts voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation My other favorite was William Squire whose voice is appropriately strong for Gandalf The only actor who seemed inappropriate was Michael Scholes as Sam whose voice acting was irritating and added to Sams unfortunately silly image The only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names Particularly strange was the decision to frequently have Saruman referred to as Aruman In producing this film Ralph Bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films Hence this film contains about half the story from the start of The Fellowship of the Ring to the end of the battle at Helms Deep in The Two Towers The obvious implication of this is that the films story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books I enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations but the liberties taken to compress the story didnt bother me even the choice to leave Arwen out of the story Enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the Lord of the Rings story in minutes The battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at Helms Deep were tremendous Ralph Bakshis version of The Lord of the Rings isnt perfect and no doubt a number of Lord of the Rings readers lament the cuts to the story However for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy My only strong lament is that I am unable to see the second part of this first great tale of The Lord of the Rings since Bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel

On the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there Mary Richards Mary Tyler Moore and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern Valerie Harper meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up on each others lives What a novel concept But sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years So instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner The supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone Moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself If this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like Its not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work At one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors Or for that matter among potential audiences Quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic

As gently as I can I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time I did not find it the warm emotionally satisfying film others did I found it boring with music that distracted from the film The story was thin the characters overdrawn and the direction pedestrian Fooey Now Im going to write some more about this movie so I make the line minimum There really isnt more to be said and brevity is important but IMDb has its minimums so here goes Young eager kid finds nascent talent seeks time with aging embittered mentor in spite of fathers cartoonish homophobia Aging embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little conflict arises While I dont think this is a spoiler Ive added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much Mostly I just found the film boring and pretentious A waste of my time I honestly dont understand what little fuss there seems to be mostly on this web site about the transcendent quality of this movie I think its really worth avoiding But as Dennis Miller used to say Maybe Im wrong

Enough is enough sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead The first Tremors movie was great The second one was ridiculous The third one was nauseating The tv series was depressingly awful And this movie just drives the stake deeper Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry now we have the series set in the Wild West in the s and they fight graboids Like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again Mildly entertaining I suppose Otherwise this straight to video release just like Tremors and is just going way too far Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event I think something like this would be history making so our pals in the first film wouldnt be so unprepared Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy Avoid this garbage

This movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices Movie history The director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women When his wife discovered the film reels he was forced to quickly contrive a story He claimed he was making a movie called The brain that wouldnt die Eventually his wife demanded that he show her his so called movie That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and The Brain that wouldnt Die was born I hate this movie Plot Synopsis The main characters fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it After reanimating the head he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers That is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie At the end he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet The monster appears with little to no explanation However the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after Side notes The end credit screen claims that the movie is called The Head that wouldnt Die I hate this movie

This film wasnt programmed in Italian cinemas I have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestival I find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and theres no suspence in the film Music is completely out of the story and I dont have words to describe the visual effects If you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busy The story is interesting but the development needs a complete review

Its amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all It is by far the number worst movie I have ever seen Not only have I ever been this bored before luckily not for more then hours the pre adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted After the first very awkward part you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better You hope in vain it only goes downhill from there The movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non story three times One can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and Trent Harris never lays his hands on a camera again

Yeah Pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about the Supremes Another recycled storyline glitzed up Hollywood style borrowing scripts from better making it in the music industry films Nothing original here More make up glammier costumes and choreography more money for the questionably talented Beyonce draw If you like the throwback style you should appreciate actual groups who struggled without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire Beyonces involvement makes this hypocritical garbage

This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With Saw it years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about romance everything else history if that Its what I call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a scam This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunters character Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldnt have lasted two days it would have either been the stockade or the infantry Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce In short another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment

Yes this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre Still I did not like this one at all About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life Crappy sex scenes to follow Why are they crappy for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way but it is still very erotic and nice to look at Of course the girls in that one are very cute Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre I mean there is a snake in one of them people So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all but rather turns me off

I have watched some pretty poor films in the past but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it I am a fan of most genres and enjoy shoot em up games but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable As most have already said there was hardly any script and the acting was weak I wont waste my time describing it Anyone who rates this film above has to be part of the production company or Sega or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment I must say I was more annoyed with the video shop who gave this a thumbs up which led me to rent it Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies Comic book guy would be right if he said Worst movie ever

I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time back in It was round that time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke It was an excellent version and very much like the book Years later I laid eyes on this version and was horrified William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester Mr Rochester is a passionate character where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough It was like watching two zombies together This is story about love and passion but I couldnt see it in this version No back to the BBC version A wonderful time is guaranteed

Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies This movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move with a passion The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first minutes through the rest of the movie Someone mentioned that this film was about a childs imagination okay thats all good and fine But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did I mean come on the Indian in the store Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this This is a move that I recommend NOT to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that wont insult your intelligence Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie I would have demanded my money back For those that were easily entertained by this movie its very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie

The movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar All of them are making up a bit outrageous stories As the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true However beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed This revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen The rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies Sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development I found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat traders story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends On a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent

I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture I finally know what hell is like Its this movie For eternity This movie has no value It didnt even really have a plot There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie Dont even watch it Not even to see how bad it is I beg you If you watch it then it means they win

Well thats minutes of my life I wont get back This movie makes teen tv show California Dreams look like Almost Famous The acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic Dont even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isnt enough irony in the world to accept that one The guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that I blame him if I was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting Id be injecting the horse too If you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs

Dont get me wrong Dan Jansen was a great speed skater If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics it was Dan But how can it be possible that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story because the real Dan Jansen story is truly incredible Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate their technique the dimensions of the speedskating oval it is all wrong Shame on you Bill Corcoran Dan Jansen deserves better a lot better out of

Even though this was a made for TV production theres absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product This movie DID have a budget and it had a casting department so if youre going to make a movie about a true life story and actually put the true story in the title shouldnt some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism First of all this movie is absurdly cast These actors belong in daytime television soaps or in those ridiculous Lifetime channel movies and not in a real life gangster criminal tale Everything about them from their looks to their mannerisms just screams of the s shopping mall alt rock listening generation What about the script Two words describes it stupid and insulting and again its way too ish sounding I dont think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words Im outta here Its as if a bunch of New Kids on the Block fans got together and decided to make a really kewl flick about Bonnie and Clyde you know one that would be totally rad and rockin Well this sticker doesnt even rank on the rad and rockin scale Everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here from the casting and acting to the editing and music Every single thing is grossly wrong and its infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put the true story in the title Its certainly NOT the true story but even worse its not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick thats accepted on its own terms Like I stated in my heading its simply horrible beyond words on every level imaginable Trust me on this or watch at your own risk

When the film began I was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera In fact the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie Even direct to DVD films should have production values better than this Heck a large percentage of the home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values All too often the film seriously appears to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on with no camera person Closeups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they might have worked and in others there are too many or poorly framed closeups Yecch The film is about two gay men who want to become married As if was made almost a decade ago their only option was marrying in Vermont times have definitely changed However the recent acceptance of gay marriage cannot in any way be attributed to this film if anything it set the gay marriage supporters back instead of helping as the movie stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue According to the film religious people are one dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot people as well as wives who have gay husbands are narrow minded when they learn their spouses have been living a lie go figure Im sure glad it gives an honest chance to both sides on the issue The bottom line nothing about the film shows any professionalism at all and I even hesitate to call this a film Its more like a home movie and doesnt even merit a listing on IMDb or even inclusion on IMDbs Bottom list of the worst rated films of all time The acting is horrible the writing is horrible the direction if there even is any is horrible the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible Its a home movie There is nothing positive I can say about this in any way except that it makes the films of Ed Wood seem like Oscar contenders in comparison and I am sure the ghost of Mr Wood is smiling every time someone watches this mess I dont care if you are gay or straight this film is not worth your time and I dont know how they managed to create DVDs of it I assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his free time Seriously this gives new meaning to the word bad By the way if the one lady in the film WAS a real lawyer wouldnt the ability to read be an important prerequisite Im just sayin Finally with gay marriage being such a serious and important topic cant we have a film thats BETTER than THIS that addresses the issue This one sadly only invites laughter

Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but I got chance only recently I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans what I saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed I could not understand what was the message except demeaning Hinduism I am more like many religion type but I felt Kamal Hasan is a man low character to have orchestrated this kind of thought He could have made a horror movie than this crap He tried to add Hollywood genre of viruses and god forbid he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world domination This is a much befitting movie for a film school vs regular public Shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has Starting of story tried Chaos to borrow ideas from Butterfly effect then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism Once again I insult Hinduism more but this movie has no equal and my insult is same for religion in general which may have made this movie intellectual one

When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film I know it is bad I wanted to claw my eyes out I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to unwatch if only it were possible The other films being Troll and Fast and Furious both which are better than this crap in the hat I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name To Mike Myers I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World Just because it worked for Jim Carrey doesnt mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians

Be warned This is crap that other crap wont even deign to be in company with because its beneath them Okay got that out of the way let me say something more substantive Ive seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director Wong Kar Wai Well despite of all of that WKW hasnt succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans mostly it is just shots of dripping water beads of sweats legs of horses running etc I couldnt sit through most of the movie Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr Wongs movies another shot after hearing many praises especially from Cannes I was intrigued by his latest A friend told me to start w Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies So wrong I was just p o that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah Its all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it But no he merely shows what is Faye Wongs acting is very typical of Hong Kongs style garbled enunciation deer in the headlight wide eye expression try to be cute and girlish kind of acting the rest of the cast is equally uninspired I think the word Auteur is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different which is to be applauded but not one who hasnt yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling which is what Mr Wong is for the last years

The film portrays Frances unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in Western Francophone Africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman France herein symbolically representing her nation It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young womans desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past in particular and a nations desire to reach out to the other it once owned and moulded This is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling or being in transit from the present to the past remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities The characters all play a symbolic albeit a limited and unconvincing role France meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality The rest of the rag tag ensemble is just forgettable The black Africans are to say the least offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the directors poor handling of her material They are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe like France wonders seeking a world she never knew and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon

I saw this film at a pre release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills As I recall the films producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our reaction Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror film If the audience wasnt scared it seems the filmmakers were They delayed release for over a year Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if theyd re cut it as far as I can tell they hadnt It was the same lousy movie just a year older It almost qualifies as so bad its good but its slow paced and boring

Well what can you say about sitcoms There often quite lame morale dedicative and just plain So is this show It got a boring cast although A Bynes is okej in her perky way the rest is just stereotypical crap as always We have all seen it before and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled Cause lets face it its a mediocre and self righteous show As the most sitcoms are Well in short If you wanna see some good entertainment you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror Do some faces and move on Its more entertaining than this show

This is a truly abysmal LOCK STOCK clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I hadnt have paid good money for it Id have turned it off after minutes Not the worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie I use the term loosely GUMMO I feel like suing that so called director for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it Definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they dont have a monopoly on truly awful films

The documentary and we use that term loosely apparently summarizes that Muslims are trying to violently take over the world Then states that any Muslim that doesnt admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face Also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them What the West NEEDS to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets If you are looking for an actual documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle East I would look elsewhere Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources

this is just a terrible comedy it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i dont know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be smartest or quality perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now thats funny i dont know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database its more like a home video than an actual film jokes aside just skip this film a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche ridden unfunny material

Ive seen the original non dubbed German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies Rabid Grannies Zombie Lake and such nothing couldve prepared me for this It really was a pain to sit through this flick as theres no plot no good acting and even the special effects arent convincing especially the so called zombies wearing nothing more than white make up and their old clothes so their good set wouldnt be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains If you really want to waste minutes of your life then watch it for all the others dont do it because you WILL regret it

I have seen many good Korean Movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone but this one sucks The director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk The movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller I cant believe someone really made such a movie Even though acting is OK the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful I am sure I am not going to see any movies of this director No sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments All this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling Very disappointing movie and I strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort

I own home entertainment stores and Ive seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it How bad was it Lets just say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III when compared to Giada Colagrandes in this movie It was robotic and uninspired Her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the Rubber House he had given her Once there she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her Within a day she starts a relationship with Leslie Dafoe the caretaker of the house Even though she is married to Dafoe off screen her scenes with him were cold and unemotional If there was a plot I missed it Not even Willem Dafoe could save this movie from the amateur cinematic train wreck that it is

When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom movies I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers I loved their Scary Movie and even enjoyed White Chicks Little Man however had very few laughs and the jokes were stale Obviously the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison He and his partner Tracy Morgan steal a diamond meant for a gangster Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington In order to get the diamond back the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep Of course he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour All these talents however cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK I mean it was not believable but it was OK nothing great I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses Wait for it on cable or television It really is not worth any amount of money
